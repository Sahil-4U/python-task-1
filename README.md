# üßÆ Basic Math Operations in Python

This Python program allows users to:

1. Calculate the **factorial** of a number.
2. Perform basic **math operations** using Python‚Äôs built-in `math` module, including:
   - Square root
   - Natural logarithm
   - Sine (in radians)

## üìù How It Works

### 1. Factorial Calculation

The program first asks the user to enter a number. It then calculates the factorial of that number using a recursive function.

### 2. Math Module Operations

After that, the program asks for another number and performs the following:

- **Square root**
- **Natural logarithm** (`log`)
- **Sine** value (in **radians**)
