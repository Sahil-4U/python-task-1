# My Python Math Program

Hi! This is a small Python project I made to practice math and Python.

## What it does:

- It asks you to enter two numbers.
- Then it shows:
  - Addition of the numbers
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division

After that, it asks for your first name and last name and says hello to you.

## Example:

If you type:

First number: 5
Second number: 10
First name: John
Last name: Doe

## It will show:

Addition: 15
Subtraction: -5
Multiplication: 50
Division: 0.5
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python program.
